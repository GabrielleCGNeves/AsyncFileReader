> Overall, this code is designed to extract links from a file and return them in an array of objects.The code exports a function named "pegaArquivo" that receives a file path as a parameter and returns an array of objects containing the links and their descriptions found in the file. 
> The "pegaArquivo" function uses the "fs.promises" module to read the content of the file and then extracts the links using a regular expression stored in the "extraiLinks" function. If an error occurs during the file reading process, the "trataErro" function is called to handle it.
> The "extraiLinks" function receives a string of text as a parameter and uses a regular expression to extract links and their descriptions, returning an array of objects with this information.
